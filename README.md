# ExpSharp

ExpSharp is a .NET library for fitting exponential curves to collections of data points. The primary goal of ExpSharp, in contrast to many other mathematics libraries, is minimalism and simplicity. ExpSharp has no dependencies and its source code is kept simple with the intention of being easily read.
